# 🚀 Deployment Status - Animal LIMS Request-Assignment System

## ✅ **Ready for Deployment**

The animal LIMS has been successfully transformed from a direct claiming system to a proper **request-assignment workflow** that reflects real laboratory operations.

## 🗄️ **Database Schema Status**

### **Core Schema (`db/schema.sql`)**
✅ **CURRENT** - Contains all base functionality:
- ✅ Users with proper roles (facility_manager, researcher, etc.)
- ✅ Complete animal management system
- ✅ Animal requests system with full workflow
- ✅ Animal request allocations and status tracking
- ✅ Housing management
- ✅ Time series measurements (auto-applied on startup)

### **Required Migrations for Full Feature Set**
1. **✅ Notifications System** - `/db/migrations/add_notifications_system.sql`
2. **✅ Time Series Measurements** - `/db/migrations/add_time_series_measurements.sql` (auto-applied)

## 🎯 **Deployment Instructions**

### **For Fresh Railway Deployment:**

1. **Deploy the current codebase** - Schema will auto-deploy
2. **Apply notifications migration** via API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.com/api/admin/apply-migration \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"migration": "add_notifications_system"}'
   ```

### **Alternative: Manual Database Setup**
If needed, run these in order:
1. Core schema: `db/schema.sql`
2. Notifications: `db/migrations/add_notifications_system.sql`
3. Time series: `db/migrations/add_time_series_measurements.sql`

## 🔧 **New Features Available After Deployment**
